For further information, refer to:

The lambda_function.py contains the necessary code, but before copying and pasting it, create a lambda function with the blueprint "sns-message-python" and select your topic. Then you can proceed.

The python.zip contains the discord-webhook module. Upload the layer to AWS Lambda before testing the code.
